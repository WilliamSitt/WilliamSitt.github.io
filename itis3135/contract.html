        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">William C. Sitthiphone</a>, agree to abide by the terms of the
             course contract in my Spring 2024, ITIS 3135, Web App Design and Development, with my instructor,
              Professor D.I. von Briesen.</p>
        <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the
             world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to
              keep private.</p>
        <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.
             As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
        <p>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many
             examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these
              resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit
               (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>
        <p>Signed: <em>William C. Sitthiphone, 01/21/2024</em></p>
