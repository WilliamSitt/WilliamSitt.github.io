        <h2>Sitthiphone Syndicate's Services</h2>
        <p>Here at Sitthiphone Syndicate, we are dedicated to protecting our clients from the many 
            threats of cybercrime. This cybersecurity firm was established in April 1, 2015 by the 
            founder and current head of Sitthiphone Syndicate, William C. Sitthiphone. After one year 
            of running the business alone, he managed to find an excellent hire, Bruce Whine, who would 
            manage operations side-by-side with William. After another year, Adam Basic would join the 
            syndicate, who would eventually become the greatest advisor at Sitthiphone Syndicate's 
            disposal. From there on out, Sitthiphone Syndicate would slowly accumulate more employees, 
            leading to the current team size of ten members. While we aren't the biggest cybersecurity 
            firm, we at Sitthiphone Syndicate will continue to diligently fight against cybercrime and 
            protect its clients from harm. Listed below are some of the things that we've managed to 
            accomplish in our time being active:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Secure/consult a total of 10,237 clients using Sitthiphone Syndicate's service</li>
            <li>Prevent a total of $298,396 in losses from malicious attacks and cyber threats</li>
            <li>Partnered with a total of 352 affiliates, with affiliates earning up to 30% in 
                commissions</li>
            <li>Confronted a total of 5,488 black hat hackers through the web directly and indirectly</li>
            <li>Assisted in securing classified information from the government</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We at Sitthiphone Syndicate offer our clients an array of services to keep them secure from 
            any cyber threats. One such service is receiving direct help from one of our consultants. 
            There is also the option of using the AI assistant or receiving asynchronous consulting via 
            text messaging. One last option is using our online security application, which can be 
            installed into a computer or cellular device. This application has many helpful features, 
            one of them being a high-quality VPN. If you would like to receive any direct consulting or 
            have any questions, please email sitthiphonesyndicate@gmail.com or call 1-800-525-5225. If 
            you would like to visit us, our main place of operations is located at the address 125 Secure 
            Drive, Charlotte, NC 23941.</p>
